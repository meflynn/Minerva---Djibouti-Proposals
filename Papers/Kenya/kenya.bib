The dataset is coded according to both the Correlates of War and the Gleditsch and Ward (1999) state lists, and is therefore compatible with a great number of existing databases in the discipline. Provided in a geographic data format, CShapes can be used directly with standard GIS software, allowing a wide range of spatial computations. In addition, we supply a CShapes package for the R statistical toolkit. This package enables researchers without GIS skills to perform various useful operations on the GIS maps. The paper introduces the CShapes dataset and structure and gives three examples of how to use CShapes in political science research. First, we show how results from quantitative analysis can be depicted intuitively as a map. The second application gives an example of computing indicators on the CShapes maps, which can then be used in statistical tests. Third, we illustr...},

@article{BarbieriSchneider1999,
	abstract = {`Globalization' has largely superseded the term `economic interdependence' to describe the rapidly growing links between nations, economies, and societies. The effects that the internationalization of the world system has on social equality, the environment, and economic growth are, however, still largely disputed. In this article, we discuss the literature that covers another intensively debated issue and which attempts to assess the relationship between trade and interstate conflict. Although liberal economists maintain that economic interdependence exerts an unconditionally pacifying influence on interstate relations, we show that the most recent formal work expects that trade will have a negligible and, in the perspective of one important model at least, even an amplifying effect on conflict. Much empirical work, by contrast, supports the claim that the relationship between trade and conflict is direct and not mitigated by contextual factors. We review the different controversies on the link between economic interdependence and militarized disputes and outline some major challenges that have not yet been adequately dealt with in the scientific study of war and peace.},

This study draws on conflict variables from the Correlates of War (COW) project to ask a critical question: how do different types of conflict affect country growth rates? It finds that wars slow the economy. Estimates indicate that civil war reduces annual growth by 0.01--0.13 percentage points, and high-intensity inter-state conflict reduces annual growth by 0.18--2.77 percentage points. On the other hand, low-intensity conflict slows growth much less than high-intensity conflict, and may slightly increase it. The detrimental effect of conflict on growth is intensified when examining non-democracies, low-income countries, and countries in Africa.},

@article{Fordham2003,
	abstract = {Three complementary explanations are tested for the phenomenon that, since 1940, the inflation rate for military goods and services has been higher on average than the inflation rates for the nonmilitary government sector or the economy as a whole. First, higher rates of public-sector inflation are often attributed to the low productivity of labor-intensive government activities compared with the relatively capital-intensive private sector. Because military goods and services are not necessarily labor intensive, however, this pattern explains only a small part of military inflation. A second, more important, consideration is that rapid buildups in military spending, usually associated with wars, lead to high inflation. For political reasons, however, retrenchments at the ends of wars do not produce a corresponding drop in prices, leading to higher average inflation over time. Finally, there is evidence that the Pentagon's interest in higher military spending may have influenced the construction of the deflator series.},

	abstract = {Spatial dependence exists whenever the expected utility of one unit of analysis is affected by the decisions or behavior made by other units of analysis. Spatial dependence is ubiquitous in social relations and interactions. Yet, there are surprisingly few social science studies accounting for spatial dependence. This holds true for settings in which researchers use monadic data, where the unit of analysis is the individual unit, agent, or actor, and even more true for dyadic data settings, where the unit of analysis is the pair or dyad representing an interaction or a relation between two individual units, agents, or actors. Dyadic data offer more complex ways of modeling spatial-effect variables than do monadic data. The commands described in this article facilitate spatial analysis by providing an easy tool for generating, with one command line, spatial-effect variables for monadic contagion as well as for all possible forms of contagion in dyadic data.},

Previous scholarship focuses on leaders' efforts to gain better terms of agreement either by playing their cards close to the vest at the bargaining table or by leveraging/avoiding aroused public opinion at home. Yet, in many cases, it is neither dyadic nor domestic political pressures that motivate leaders' decisions to publicly acknowledge or conceal the occurrence of talks. This article suggests, instead, that third-party states often constitute the primary targets of official secrecy and that a state's international power position shapes its decision to conceal or acknowledge military cooperation by affecting the size and attentiveness of international audiences, the types of assets it brings to the relationship and the benefits it seeks from cooperation. I test five hypotheses about leaders' use of secrecy and acknowledgment through a statistical analysis of an original dataset on US overseas military basing negotiations. This analysis produces strong support for my argument.},

	abstract = {Why might public acknowledgment of cooperative security negotiations generate bargaining constraints that provoke stalemate? Previous scholarship points to aroused public opinion. Yet in many cases where hard-line bargaining stances develop and talks collapse following public acknowledgment, it is not domestic political pressures that tie leaders' hands. This article examines instead an international constraint attendant to publicity: opposition by third-party states. I argue that international power position shapes the balance of vulnerability between the negotiating parties to abandonment and entanglement. The act of official acknowledgment can constrain the more vulnerable partner by enabling third-party states to credibly scrutinize its intentions. By threatening strained relations, such scrutiny can create a security dilemma that reduces the weaker partner's bargaining range to a choice between cooperation on its terms and noncooperation. I evaluate this argument by studying foreign military basing n...},

  abstract      = {This paper builds on previous research into determinants of military spending by examining global and local spatial effects. Other research has examined the effects of regional differences and neighbours' spending levels with standard econometric techniques. This paper uses spatial econometrics to gain a better understanding of the influence of location and distance on levels of defence spending. I find that a spatial lag specification provides much more robust evidence of arms racing and security dilemma dynamics than previous studies. These basic dynamics have been difficult to detect empirically without the context and nuance introduced by spatial modelling. The paper represents a first cut at the topic, but two specific findings emerge. First, globally there is positive spatial correlation (nearby states have similar levels of spending). This conforms to arms racing and security dilemma expectations. And, second, locally there is variation in the patterns of spatial clustering across broad international regions (e.g. Europe, Asia etc.). The second finding supports previous research suggesting important qualitative regional variation in patterns of defence spending and international conflict. The models also confirm the effects of political regime type and interstate war on defence spending, and are robust to the inclusion of a temporally lagged dependent variable.

	abstract = {Using global data for the period 1960-99, Collier and Hoeffler estimate neighborhood arms races. They find that the level of military expenditure is strongly influenced by the expenditure of neighbors. The authors estimate an "arms race multiplier," finding that an initial exogenous increase in military expenditure by one country is more than doubled in both the originating country and its neighbor. An implication is that military expenditure is, to an extent, a "regional public bad." Potentially, there is an offsetting public good effect if rebellions are deterred by military expenditure. However, instrumenting for military expenditure, the authors find no deterrence effect of military spending on the risk of internal conflict. So there appears to be no regional public good effect offsetting the public bad arising from a neighborhood arms race. This paper - a product of the Development Research Group - is part of a larger effort in the group to study the economics of conflict.},

	abstract = {Military expenditures of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China are examined from two perspectives: (1) a modification of the traditional Richardson arms race formulation and (2) the notion that the military budget is used by decision makers, in part, to respond to the domestic political and economic environment. These competing formulations are juxtaposed in an empirical analysis of their relevance for understanding contemporary arms allocation decisions. The empirical evaluation of these processes is informed by a critical appraisal of alternative assessments of military allocations, as reflected in data provided by the Stockholm Institute for Peace Research International, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and William T. Lee, a noted defense analyst. The findings suggest that the arms race formulation is empirically deficient in accounting for the spending patterns of the United States, Soviet Union, and People's Republic of China in the period from 1949 to 1978. For both the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the use of the military allocation process to influence domestic political and economic conditions receives considerable support. It is also clear from the analysis conducted that the choice of data, especially with regard to Soviet spending, plays a significant role in these findings.},

This article presents evidence that unemployment and inflation produce differences in the likelihood of a diversionary use of force by presidents from different parties. Because Republicans are more reluctant than Democrats to use potentially inflationary macroeconomic policies to reduce unemployment, they are more likely to use military force than Democratic presidents when unemployment is high. One the other hand, because Democrats are reluctant to employ macroeconomic policies that might control inflation at the cost of increased unemployment, they are more likely to use military force than Republicans when facing high inflation.},

We obtained these estimates by regressing observed values of GDP in the 1950-1997 period onto energy consumption, iron and steel production, total population, and urban population.'' Their threat variable: Identify ``strategic rivals'' for each state as per William Thompson (2001)'s classification. Then use COW's CINC of each rival to indicate the level of threat each state faces. Their alliance variable: Use Type I alliances' in COW. Use the total CINC scores of alliances. For their war variable, they use battle deaths. Use a Prais-Winsten regression with panel-corrected standard errors.},

This result is counterintuitive, particularly when compared with the statements of US defense planners. In addition, most explanations lack an explicit characterization of decisionmaking and decisionmakers. This article addresses these twin problems by developing a model of US defense expenditure policymaking which is based upon the following principles of cybernetic behavior: (a) decisionmakers are boundedly rational; (b) they respond to a limited number of environmental factors in a hierarchic fashion; and (c) the structure of this hierarchy is a function of `survival' considerations. A multiactor, multistage model is operationalized and tested for the period of Fiscal Years 1947-1980. This article concludes that the hierarchic search structure posited by the cybernetic approach is a reasonable approximation to the behavior of the major actors in the US defense expenditure process.},

	abstract = {The causes of the dramatic rise in military spending in the post-war era have been the subject of much political and academic controversy. No extant formulation seems to provide a compelling explanation of the dynamics involved in the levels of, and rates of change in, such spending. In light of this, the authors develop a new model, based mainly on a political-business cycle argument, to account for these dynamics. The basic proposition in this model is that variations in national defense spending arise from political considerations which are related to real and desired conditions within the national economy. Applying this model to the experience of the United States 1948-1976, the authors show that it has a large measure of empirical validity. If one removes the effects of war-time mobilization, it is clear that for the United States the principal driving forces in military spending dynamics were (1) the perceived utility of such spending in stabilizing aggregate demand, (2) the political or electoral value of the perceived economic effects arising out of such spending, and (3) the pressures of institutional-constituency demands.},

Also- there is a tradeoff between defense spending and domestic spending in small allied states but not large allied states. Right governments in small allied states spend more on defense. There is no relationship between ideology and defense spending in large allied states.  Of note from the article: Allied states: He begins by summarizing the argument that applies the ``collective action problem'' to alliances. Large states in an alliance should contribute more to defense as a percentage of their GNP than small states. Small states will free ride off of the large states efforts. He then applies the logic of the ``repeated prisoner's dilemma'' to alliance politics. He argues that if states have a long term interest in staying in an alliance, they will create norms to ensure they all play TIT FOR TAT. These norms will dictate how many resources each state will contribute to the alliance, and will encourage states to increase spending in the alliance when other states increase spending, or decrease spending when other states decrease spending. Last, he discusses the tradeoff between defense spending and domestic spending in large versus small allied states. In large states, like the US, there is no trade off. Defense spending is primary, and is not constrained by domestic spending. In small states, there is a tradeoff. Furthermore, in small allied states, more conservative governments spend more on defense. My notes: Maybe include a control variable to account for this in our models? Nonallied states: The amount of resources the US spends on defense should not be tied to defense burden of nonallied states. The US has no obligation to contribute to the security of nonallied states. My thoughts: On the other hand, defense spending by nonallied states should be tied to US troop deployment. If the states are friendly, then there should be a negative relationship. Those states will free ride off the US efforts. If the states are neutral or enemies, there should be a positive relationship. Those states will increase spending when the US deploys more troops.},

(3) There is a tradeoff between defense spending and domestic spending in small allied states but not large allied states. (4) Right governments in small allied states spend more on defense. However, there is no relationship between ideology and defense spending in large allied states. Of note from the article: They test three hypotheses: Allied states free ride of US defense spending. Allied states increase spending on defense when the US does, but to a lesser degree. Allied states increase spending on defense to the same degree as the US- they do this not because they're cooperating with the US but they see the same increase in threat in the international environment as the US. Their threat variable: ``The variable used to measure the level of international tension for the years  1949-78  is  derived from  the  Conflict  and  Peace  Data  Bank (COPDAB), as  developed  by  Edward  Azar.  The degree  of  conflict  or cooperation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union  for each year is used as  an  index  of the tension  between  East  and West. The tension variable for each year is (Con - Coop) / (Con  +  Coop) where  ``Con'' is the  number of conflictual acts (coded  9 through  15) and ``Coop'' is the number of cooperative acts (1 through 7 in COPDAB) that took place between the two states. (Acts coded ``8'' in the COPDAB data were excluded from analysis.)  The index thus can vary from + 1.00 (for all conflictual acts) to - 1.00 (for all cooperative acts). The international tension measure for 1979-1984 is taken from Kegley and Wittkopf (1987:  57).''},

Perhaps we can assume that if a host country accepts US troops, they either want to change the SQ- increase security in their state- increase military spending...or maintain the security SQ and then change the SQ on another foreign policy area. Assumes that the more resources a state has, the more they can spend on foreign policy goods. Maybe start out by saying- We assume the US places troops in other countries for security purposes. We assume that host states accept the troops for one of three reasons- to increase security, to reallocate resources to other foreign policy areas, or to reallocate resources to other domestic policy areas. States will engage in more change seeking and more maintenance seeking behavior as their resources increase. pg. 35 Joining an alliance allows a state to engage in more change or maintenance seeking policies. If the alliance provides maintenance, the state will allocated resources away from defense (a maintenance policy) and more towards change seeking policies (foreign aid)- and vice versa if it is an alliance that promotes change. pgs. 41-42. Results suggest that when states join alliances, they increase military spending and increase their military capabilities.},
